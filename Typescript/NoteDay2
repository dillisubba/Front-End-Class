Advantages
-------------------
It supports strongly typed, functions, optional parameters.
It supports object oriented programming like class, object, encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism.
It is fast , simple and easy to learn.
It provides error checking feature at compile time.
It supports all javascript libraries.
It supports reusability of code.


Node.js
------------
It is a cross platform runtime environment and library for running javascript applications.
It is an open source.
It is used for creating server-side and networking applications.


Typescript consists of modules, functions, variables, statements, comments.


Differences between javascript and typescript
---------------------------------------------------------------------
javascript - doesn't support strongly typed.
Typescript - supports strongly typed.

JS - extension is ".js"
TS - extension is ".ts"

JS - directly runs on browser
TS - It cannot directly run on browser.

JS - It is a scripting language and object based language.
TS - It is an object oriented programming languae.


Disadvantages
--------------------------
Typescript takes a long time to compile the code.

Typescript - Type Annotations
-------------------------------------------------
Typescript is typed language where we can specify the type of variable, function parameters and object properties.
Typescript includes all the primitive types of javascript.
number, string, boolean

syntax:
------------
var/let variablename:typeannotation =value;
eg:

let x : number=45;
let fname:string="srinivas";
let result:boolean=true;


variable
---------------
It is a memory location which has some name and value.
we can declare variables using var, let and const.

Differences between var ,let and const
----------------------------------------------------------
let
----
It is used to declare a local variable in typescript.
It is similar to var keyword but it has some restrictions in scope while comparing with var.
A variable which is declared with let keyword is limited to block scope only.

eg: let num1:number=56;

var
------
It can be declared globally and can be accessed globally.

var num2:number=56;
const
--------
A variable can be declared using const which is similar to var and let.
The const makes a variable constant where its value cannot be changed.
const variables have same scope as let variables.

const num3:number=87;




Built in types
----------------------
number, string, boolean, void, ..

number - we can store numbers and fractions.
void - which does not return any value.
any - It is used where no data type is available. It is the super type of all data types.
undefined - uninitialized variable.
null - whose value is undefined.

user defined types
---------------------------
class, array, tuple, functions,...

operators
---------------
Arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/,%)
Assignment operators (+=,-=,*=,/=,%=)
Relational operators (>,<,>=,<=,==,!=)
Logical operators ( &&, ||, ||!)
Ternary operator (? : )

----------------------------------
Arithmetic operators
----------------------------
let num1:number=20;
let num2:number=10;
console.log("num1 is "+num1);
console.log("num2 is "+num2);
console.log("Addition is "+(num1+num2));
