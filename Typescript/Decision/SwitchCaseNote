switch case
-------------------
It executes one statement from multiple conditions.
It evaluates expression based on its value which can be number, string, boolean etc.,
switch statement can have one block of code corresponding to each value.
when the match is found the corresponding block will be executed.

we can have N number of cases inside switch statement.
every case statement has a break statement at the end of the block.
The default statement is optional.

switch(expression)
{
case expression1:
//statements;
break;
