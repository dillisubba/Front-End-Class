Decision making
-------------------------
Decision making in programming is similar to decision making in real life.
Programmer uses decision making for specifying one or more conditions to be evaluated by program.
The decision making always returns true or false.

if..else
----------
This statement tests the condition. If the condition is true, it executes if block and if the condition is false, it executes the else block.

syntax:
----------
if(condition)
{
//statements;
}
else
{
//statements;
}
----------------------

if..else .. if ladder
---------------------------

A user can take decision among multiple options.
It starts execution in a top down approach. When the condition gets true, it executes the associated statement and the rest of the condition is not executed.
If it does not find any condition true then it returns the final else statement.

syntax:
--------------
if(condition)
{
//statements;
}
else if(condition)
{
//statements;
}
else
{
//statements;
}
