Typescript Tuples
----------------------------

Array holds multiple values of same data type.
If we need to store a collection of values of different data types in a single variable then array is not sufficient.
Typescript has a data type called Tuple to perform.
A Tuple is an array which stores multiple fields which belongs to different types.

syntax:
-----------
let tuplename=[value1, value2,...];

eg:
let studentdata=["10","srinivas","11","Krishna","12","venkat"];
console.log(studentdata);

let studentdata=["10","srinivas","11","Krishna","12","venkat"];
console.log(studentdata);

let studentdata1=[10,"srinivas",11,"Krishna",12,"venkat"];
console.log(studentdata1);

let empdata=[];
empdata[0]=23;
empdata[1]="srinivas";
console.log(empdata);
