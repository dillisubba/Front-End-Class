Looping Constructs
------------------------------

Loop
--------
It is a sequence of instructions repeated more than once.

while loop
do..while loop
for loop


Initialization
condition
increment/decrement


while loop
----------------
It iterates the elements for the infinite number of times.
It executes the instructions repeatedly until the specified condition evaluates to true.
It is used when the number of iterations is not known.

syntax:
-----------
initialization;
while(condition)
{
//statements;
increment/decrement;
}

//Display 1 to 5 numbers.

let num1:number=1; //initialization
while(num1<=5) //condition
{
console.log(num1);
num1++; //increment
}
------------------

do..while loop
-----------------------
It iterates the elements for the infinite number of times which is similar to while loop.
But the difference is that do..while loop gets executed at least once whether the condition is true or false.

syntax:
----------
initialization;
do
{
//statements;
increment/decrement;
}while(condition);

//Display 10 to 1 numbers.

let num2:number=10; //initialization
do{
console.log(num2);//10
num2--; //decrement
}while(num2>=1); //condition

----------------
for loop
--------------
We know the number of iterations before the execution of the block of statements.
It is used to execute a block of code to a specific number of times.

syntax:
------------
for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement)
{
//statements;
}

//display 1 to 10 numbers using for loop
let num3:number;
for(num3=1;num3<=10;num3++)
{
console.log(num3);
}
